The Odin Project Fullstack Javascript Projects

A repo for the second half of my Odin Project journey. I've decided to centralise all projects I do while progressing through TOP's JS path here 
because seeing how cluttered my repos are due to the Foundations path projects makes me very sad. :(

Heaven forbid anyone ever looks at my commit history but I'll prefix the name of the sub-project a commit belongs to in the message to keep things a little less painful for you, brave soul.

So yeah that's my little spiel on this, hopefully my baby steps in web development aren't too bad and thanks for passing through. Cheers! :)
